The iPhone Photo Renamer (IPR) renames the pictures and videos exported from iOS devices from standard IMG_XXXX.HEIC format to more representative IPH_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.HEIC based on the date and time the picture/video was taken. THe date is extracted from EXIF metadata of the pictures.

Requirements: 
 - exiftools
 - Linux/MacOS terminal

Usage:

run ./iosphotorenamer.sh "path to file or folder"

TLDR: This app renames iPhone photos to use the time taken as its name.
